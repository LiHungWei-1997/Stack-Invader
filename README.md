# Stack-Invader

This homework is inspired by the classic arcade game Space Invader, 
but the rules and the mechanics are different from the original game.

We need to implement an internal control system that monitoring the enemiesâ€™ positions. 
The game logic is modified and simplified to make sure the problem can be solved with C/C++ basic and the understanding of the queue and stack.

## The goal
- Building wheels
  - Queue
  - Stack
- Implement the game core
  - Monitoring enemy positions
  - Player commands (firing bullets & querying enemy positions)
